/**
 * Three independently-logged jobs behind one route, because Vercel Cron on
 * this project fires once a day and all three need that same daily slot —
 * deliberately not a second cron entry (the plan considered one; Hobby
 * allows only two daily-granularity jobs total, and the second slot stays
 * free rather than being spent here):
 *
 * 1. **cleanup** — enforces content/retention.ts, deleting whatever
 *    lib/retentionCutoff.ts says has expired. Reachable manually via
 *    `npm run db:cleanup` for a deployment where Cron isn't available.
 * 2. **cv-blobs** — deletes the CV blobs belonging to applications the
 *    cleanup pass just removed, then sweeps Vercel Blob for orphaned
 *    uploads (a file whose upload succeeded but whose application was
 *    never submitted) older than 24 hours. Runs in the middle, not last:
 *    it's the one pass enforcing an actual retention deadline on personal
 *    data, where a reminder mail arriving a day late is comparatively
 *    harmless. Batched (at most CV_BLOBS_MAX_ORPHANS_PER_RUN orphans per
 *    run) and budget-aware (skipped outright if CV_BLOBS_TIME_BUDGET_MS of
 *    the shared CRON_TIME_BUDGET_MS is already gone) so it can never turn
 *    one slow run into a function timeout — the rest is picked up the
 *    next day, and a skip is recorded as exactly that, not as a failure.
 * 3. **reminder-window** — mails everyone confirmed on the reminder list
 *    once an application window has opened (lib/reminderWindowMail.ts),
 *    at most once per (signup, window) pair, enforced by the database.
 *
 * Each runs in its own try/catch with its own startCronRun/finishCronRun
 * pair: a thrown error in one — including a failure to even record the
 * run's start — is caught and logged, then the handler proceeds to the
 * next regardless. No job's failure can suppress another's work or its own
 * cron_runs row, which matters most on exactly the days more than one job
 * actually has something to do.
 *
 * Auth is a single shared secret compared with a constant-time comparison
 * — not `===`, which leaks timing information about how many leading
 * bytes matched. Vercel Cron sends `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`
 * automatically once CRON_SECRET is set as a project env var; with no
 * secret configured, every request is rejected rather than left open.
