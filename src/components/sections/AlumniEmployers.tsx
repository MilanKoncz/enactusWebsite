// is also why it used to visibly run on past that area's own bottom edge —
// its `inset-0` sized itself against that much taller combined box. Now

// ProximityGroup (also driving the board portraits' lift) writes
// --proximity (0-1) onto each of its direct children from a single
// rAF-throttled pointermove listener, gated off entirely on touch and
// prefers-reduced-motion — reused as-is rather than a second hook, since it
// already is "one event on the container, throttled, cleaned up on
// unmount" (docs/design-system.md's motion rules). `.alumni-logo-cell` in
// globals.css maps that value to a transform/opacity-only scale — the cell
// itself never resizes, so neighbors never reflow, only the logo's own
// paint grows past its cell's edges into the gap around it.
//
// No pointer-events-none here, unlike most decorative aria-hidden layers on
// this site: ProximityGroup's own listener is attached to this exact
// element, and pointer-events: none makes an element (and its
// non-overriding descendants) invisible to hit-testing entirely — that was
// the actual cause of the dock effect never firing (2026-08-19 fix), not a
// missing transform or a stale hover-capability check (both were already
// correct). aria-hidden alone is enough to keep it out of the accessibility
// tree; nothing inside is a link or a button, so there is nothing this
// leaves clickable that shouldn't be.

// Below md, AlumniLogoField's auto-fill grid clips against the section's own
// overflow-hidden well before it reaches the end of even one repeat of the
// 54 logos — a narrow column count times a height-capped section only ever
// shows the first handful of rows, with no way to reach the rest (board
// feedback: most of the 54 were simply never visible on a phone). This is a
// second, mobile-only layout, not a responsive tweak to AlumniLogoField:
// every logo, once, flowing into 5 fixed rows and scrolling sideways
// instead of wrapping into more rows than the section has height for.
//
// grid-flow-col with a fixed row count (not auto-fill/wrap) is what makes a
// grid scroll horizontally at all — a wrapping grid has no "sideways" axis
// to scroll along. overflow-x-auto alone isn't enough to keep the track
// from inflating the page's own scrollWidth on some layouts; contain-content
// (paint+layout containment) is the same fix the calendar's filter-chip row
// needed for the same reason (EventCalendar.tsx) — it stops this track's
// internal size from leaking out to the document. No scroll-snap: a logo
// wall has no "current item" the way a chip row or a card carousel does, so
// nothing here should feel like it's advancing through discrete pages.
//
// aria-hidden, same as AlumniLogoField: decorative texture, nothing
// interactive inside (content/alumniEmployers.ts's own comment: no logo
// here links out), so there's no focusable content whose focus ring
// contain-content could clip either.
