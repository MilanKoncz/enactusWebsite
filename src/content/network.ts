/**
 * Network-scale figures for Enactus Germany and Enactus Global — not this
 * club's own numbers (those are kpis.ts). Source: enactus.de/network,
 * confirmed by the board 2026-08-15. Re-confirm against enactus.de before
 * reuse if this file goes untouched for a long time — network-wide figures
 * change as the network grows.
 *
 * Deliberately no global student count. enactus.de/network and other
 * published sources disagree with each other by tens of thousands (figures
 * seen range from ~42,000 to ~70,500), so no number is trustworthy enough to
 * publish. Do not resurrect the old website's figures (2,000 members / 35
 * teams / 70,000 globally) either — those were never reconciled with this
 * source and are not confirmed to mean the same thing.
