/**
 * Shared across every form route (/api/bewerbung, /api/reminder,
 * /api/kontakt, /api/ideathon, and the reminder confirm/unsubscribe links) —
 * a fixed 10-minute window, with a per-route ceiling below. Backed by
 * rate_limit_hits in Postgres rather than an in-memory counter: a Vercel
 * deployment can serve one request from a different serverless instance
 * than the next, so a counter living in process memory would simply not see
 * most of a real flood. The IP itself is never stored, only its SHA-256
 * hash — see content/retention.ts and the Datenschutzerklärung for how long
 * a bucket lives before pruneRateLimitHits removes it.
 *
 * Peeks before writing: a request already over the limit is already over
 * it, and incrementing the counter for it anyway means the rate limiter
 * spends exactly the database write it exists to protect. This trades a
 * small, accepted race (two requests arriving in the same instant can both
 * peek under the limit and both then increment, briefly landing one over)
 * for the much larger win of a request that's clearly over the limit never
 * touching the database at all.

// minutes — fine for a low-traffic link like the reminder unsubscribe, but
// applied identically to /api/bewerbung and /api/ideathon, which a whole
// university WLAN's worth of applicants can hit from behind one shared
// egress IP. A flat 5 would have meant "five applications campus-wide per
// ten minutes" on launch morning. Raising these doesn't weaken spam
// defense: the honeypot and the signed, timed form-token
// (lib/formToken.ts) do that job and never depended on this number.
// admin-login stays at the original 5 on purpose — it's the one route this
// limit genuinely defends against a deliberate attack, not a crowd of real
