/**
 * The only file in this codebase that writes SQL. Every route in app/api/
 * goes through the typed functions below, never through a raw `sql`
 * handle — that boundary is what keeps a future column rename or query
 * change a one-file diff.
 *
 * No multi-statement transactions anywhere here, on purpose: every
 * function below is exactly one atomic SQL statement (an INSERT, a
 * conditional UPDATE, or an upsert with RETURNING), so there is nothing
 * for a transaction to coordinate. See migrations/0001_init.sql and
 * docs/deployment.md for why that's sufficient — the short version is that
 * every race this schema cares about (double-clicking a confirmation link,
 * a concurrent rate-limit hit) is resolved by a single statement's own
 * WHERE clause or ON CONFLICT clause, not by wrapping several statements
 * together.
 *
 * The Neon client is created lazily, on first use, not at module load —
 * `next build` collects route metadata for every API route without
 * running any request handler, so a client built at import time would
 * make DATABASE_URL a build-time requirement instead of a runtime one.
