/**
 * The public-facing view of the postings the board manages at /admin/jobs
 * (lib/db.ts's listActiveJobPostings — already filtered to non-expired rows
 * server-side). Cached and revalidated on a tag, not read fresh on every
 * request — same shape and reasoning as lib/calendarEvents.ts: the nav/
 * footer's "does Jobs show at all" check runs on every public page, and
 * hitting Neon on every visitor would turn that into a database load test.
 *
 * Fail-soft on purpose: a database hiccup here shows the jobs page's own
 * empty state (and drops "Jobs" from the nav), not a broken page. It's also
 * what keeps `next build` green without DATABASE_URL — the underlying call
 * fails once during prerendering, this catches it, and the page prerenders
 * with an empty list.
