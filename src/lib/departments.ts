 * The public-facing view of the "Ressort" list the board manages at
 * /admin/ressorts (lib/db.ts's listActiveDepartments). Cached and
 * revalidated on a tag, same shape and reasoning as lib/projectAreas.ts:
 * /mitmachen is a conversion page, not somewhere every visitor should
 * trigger a database round trip.
 *
 * Fail-soft on purpose: a database hiccup here shows an empty checkbox
 * list rather than breaking the form, and keeps `next build` green without
 * DATABASE_URL — the underlying call fails once during prerendering, this
 * catches it, and the page prerenders with nothing to check.
