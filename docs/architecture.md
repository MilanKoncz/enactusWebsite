# Architecture

Orientation for someone who has never opened this codebase. Read
`CLAUDE.md` first for the project's non-negotiables (no invented facts, no
AI traces in commits, the design system's rules) — this file is about how
the pieces fit together, not the rules for changing them.

For "how do I change fact X / photo Y" without touching code logic, see
`docs/content-guide.md` instead. For colors/type/motion, see
`docs/design-system.md`. For forms, the database, and privacy, see
`docs/engineering.md`. For environment variables and hosting, see
`docs/deployment.md`.

## Stack, in one line each

- **Next.js 15+ App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict.** Server components
  by default; `"use client"` only where interactivity needs it (forms,
  ticking countdowns, dialogs).
- **Tailwind CSS v4.** Tokens live in `@theme` inside `src/app/globals.css`
  — no `tailwind.config.js`.
- **next-intl.** German (no URL prefix) and English (`/en`). Every visible
  string goes through it — see "Copy vs. facts" below.
- **Neon Postgres**, via `@neondatabase/serverless`. `src/lib/db.ts` is the
  only file that writes SQL.
- **Resend** for outgoing mail (`src/lib/mail.ts`).
- **Radix UI primitives** (Dialog, Accordion, Tabs) — never full shadcn/ui.
- **motion** (Framer Motion) for the hero sequence and the handful of
  layout-animated lists (project cards). Everything else uses plain CSS
  transitions/scroll-driven animation.
- **Vitest** (unit + integration) and **Playwright** (e2e).

## Why `[locale]` has no `layout.tsx` at the app root

There is deliberately no `src/app/layout.tsx`. `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
is the only root layout — it owns `<html>`/`<body>`, fonts, and the
`NextIntlClientProvider`. Every real page lives under `[locale]`, including
`admin`. **Never add a page directly under `src/app/` outside `[locale]`** —
Next's root-layout check would regenerate a bare `app/layout.tsx` to satisfy
itself, silently breaking this setup. If you need a new top-level section,
add it as a sibling of `(site)` and `admin` under `[locale]/`.

`(site)` is a route group, not a URL segment — it exists purely to attach
Header/Footer/SkipLink to every public page without repeating that in each
one. `admin` is a separate group precisely so it does *not* get that chrome.

## Copy vs. facts: `content/` vs `messages/`

This is the one boundary to internalize before changing anything:

- **`src/content/*.ts`** holds structure and facts that aren't prose: board
  roster, project list, KPÍs, partner tiers, the recruiting window. Every
  file is Zod-validated, so a typo during a board handover fails the build
  loudly instead of breaking a page silently.
- **`src/messages/{de,en}.json`** holds every word a visitor reads:
  headlines, button labels, error messages, FAQ answers, even the bios and
  descriptions *for* the people/projects listed in `content/`.

A component usually reads both: `content/board.ts` says *who* the board
members are and in what order; `messages/de.json`'s `"Board.<slug>.bio"`
says what their bio *says*. This split exists so the data layer can move to
a CMS later without touching how components render — keep it that way; never
hardcode a name, statistic, or sentence directly inside a component.

Never invent a missing fact. A `Placeholder` (whole block, e.g. a missing
photo) or `PlaceholderMark` (inline, e.g. a missing sentence) renders
instead, and the gap gets a row in `ASSETS-TODO.md`. This is why several
pages currently show visible "missing" markers — that is working as
designed, not a bug to silently paper over.

## Request flow: the three forms

`/mitmachen` (application), `/kontakt` (contact), and the reminder sign-up
all follow the same shape, enforced by a shared Zod schema used on both the
client (`react-hook-form` + `zodResolver`) and the server (the API route):

1. Validate (honeypot + timing check for the application form — no CAPTCHA).
2. **Write to Postgres first.** `src/lib/db.ts`'s `insert*` functions.
3. Only after that succeeds: render a PDF (application) or send mail
   (`src/lib/mail.ts`, via Resend).
4. If the mail step fails, the row already has `mail_status = 'failed'` and
   `mail_error` set — the visitor is still told it worked, because their
   data is safe. The board finds the failure by querying `mail_status`, not
   by a visitor complaint.

Full detail, including the double opt-in for the reminder list and rate
limiting, is in `docs/engineering.md`.

## The admin area

Eight sections under `[locale]/admin` — applications, failed mails,
application windows, the reminder list, contact messages, deletion
requests, system status, plus an overview. Full list and what each is for:
`docs/deployment.md`'s "The admin area".

Gated by comparing a password (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) against a signed, httpOnly
session cookie (`src/lib/adminAuth.ts`, signed with `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`)
— no user-account system. The gate is applied per page and per route via
`src/lib/adminSession.ts`, never only in the layout: a layout renders its
children regardless of what it returns, so the check has to sit ahead of
each page's own query. Excluded from `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts`, with
`noindex` metadata besides, and `proxy.ts` 404s the `/en` variants.

`src/components/admin/` holds the pieces shared across sections
(`AdminNav`, `AdminTable`, `AdminLogin`, and the client components that
perform mutations). `ADMIN_SECTIONS` in `adminSections.ts` is the single
list the nav and the overview both read.

## Testing layers

- **Unit** (`tests/unit`): content schemas (a malformed `content/*.ts` must
  fail loudly), pure functions in `lib/`, and component behavior via
  Testing Library — query by role/label, never by class or test id.
- **Integration** (`tests/integration`): API routes with a mocked
  DB/mail layer. The load-bearing case: an application is persisted even
  when the mail provider throws.
- **E2E** (`tests/e2e`): real browser flows against a real
  `next build && next start` — form submission, locale switch, mobile nav,
  keyboard traversal, redirects. `npm run test:e2e` builds and starts the
  server itself; it does not need a dev server already running.

`npm run check` runs typecheck + lint + the Vitest suite. CI additionally
runs `next build` and the full Playwright suite — a change isn't done until
both are green, not just `check`.
